    "The Indian metaverse/AR/VR space is crowded with numerous seed-stage startups founded between 2020-2022, indicating a highly competitive early market.",
    "A common strategy among peers is enabling brands and enterprises with 'metaverse-as-a-service' tools, validating Ctruh's B2B no-code platform approach.",
    "Very low initial revenue is the norm for this sector; the primary focus for seed-stage companies is product development and user acquisition, not immediate monetization.",
    "There is a strong geographic concentration of competitors in Indian tech hubs like Bengaluru and Delhi NCR, creating intense competition for talent and capital."
