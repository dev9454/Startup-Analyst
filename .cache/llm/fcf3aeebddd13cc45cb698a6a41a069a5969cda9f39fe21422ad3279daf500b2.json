  "insights": [
    "The Indian savings-tech space is highly fragmented, with startups succeeding by targeting specific user behaviors (e.g., micro-savings with Jar) or models (e.g., 'Save Now, Buy Later' with Tortoise).",
    "There is a clear convergence of savings, payments, investments, and lending. Neobanks like Fi and Jupiter are bundling these services, creating competitive pressure on single-purpose apps.",
    "Monetization remains a key challenge. Models vary from brand partnerships (Hubble) to investment commissions (Jar) and interchange fees (Fi), but a clear path to profitability is not yet established for most.",
    "While funding was abundant in 2021-2022, investors now focus more on unit economics and sustainable growth, favoring startups with clear differentiation and revenue models."
